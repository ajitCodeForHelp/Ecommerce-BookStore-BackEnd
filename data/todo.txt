--Additional Notes:
-If Gmail blocks access due to security, enable App Passwords or disable "Less Secure App Access".
-Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like email and password; use a configuration service like AWS Secrets Manager or Spring Boot's encrypted configuration.

Turn on 2-Step Verification:

Go to your Google Account Security page.
Scroll down to "2-Step Verification" and turn it on (if it's not already enabled).
Follow the instructions to set up 2-Step Verification.
Generate an App Password:

Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, return to the Security page.
Scroll to "App Passwords" under the Signing in to Google section.
Select "App Passwords" and log in again if prompted.
Choose:
App: Select "Mail."
Device: Choose the appropriate device or select "Other" and give it a name (e.g., "Spring Boot App").
Click Generate. Google will give you a 16-character password.
Copy this password and save it securely (you wonâ€™t see it again).
